# Assignment for Frontend Developer Candidates for 1XL

This project is built on [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) library using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). It is recommended by the official documents of the REact to use some kind of framework to build out their application.

The project contains just 2 pages, Home and Categories. This website is not made responsive as the Figma files did not have designs for responsive layouts. This only works on desktops.

# Prerequisites

### Installing Node.js

You need a package manager `npm` to install libraries and run the React application. You can download it by installing [Node.js][nodejs] on your machine.

### Installing the Libraries

I have used a couple of Javascript libraries in this project to make my work smoother and easier. Here is a list of all the libraries used -

- styled-components
- framer-motion

All the libraries and their versions are present in the file package.json in the root folder
